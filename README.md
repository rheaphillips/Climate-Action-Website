# Climate-Action-Website
Climate change is one of the most pressing problems that our world is facing today and Canada is a major contributor, having the 7th highest CO2 emission per capita (18.72 tons annually), and 7th highest total CO2 emissions in 2016 (675,918,610 tons) (WorldOMeters). 

My culminating project is a website that helps people mainly in Mississauga, improve their climate literacy. I will specifically develop their scientific understanding of the Earthâ€™s climate over the centuries/millennia and what the current climate crisis implies for our wellbeing. This website will also provide users with the tools and resources to implement changes within their everyday lives. 

My project is inspired by the US Climate Resilience Toolkit and United Nations Climate Action, however it will be catered towards Canadian citizens (focused on those living in Mississauga), and will be very easily accessible for users with minimum knowledge on climate change.
